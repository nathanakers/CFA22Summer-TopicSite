                    <h3>Beach</h3>
                    <p>I know this is part of volleyball, but I can be at the beach anytime there’s sun. I grew up in Florida and in Southern
                    California—the beach is part of me. I’m new to Seattle, but I drive out to Golden Gardens more often than anywhere else
                    to catch the sunsets.</p>

                    <h3>Volleyball</h3>
                    <p>I played volleyball starting in high school. I was rejected from the team for two years until I finally made the team in
                    my sophomore year. After that I got really good and played club at a high level. Then in San Francisco I joined a beach
                    volleyball community where we had free clinics every week and some amazing tournaments.</p>

                    <h3>DIY Projects</h3>
                    <p>As long as I can remember I have tried my hand at art and making things. I’m not always great, but when I look back to
                    high school I find that I took woodshop, engineering, and art classes all the time; I built my own table and stools
                    during classes, and my dad still has his “DAD” keychain from when I made that for him in middle school. Lately I’ve been
                    interested in leathermaking.</p>
